Members
-------

* `rawid` (integer primary key): The id of this measurement.
* `runid` (integer): The associated [run](/models/runs).
* `starid` (integer): The associated [star](/models/stars).
* `ra` (real): The R.A. position of the measurement (based on the associated
  [star](/models/stars) model).
* `dec` (real): The Dec. position of the measurement.
* `tai` (real): The time of the measurement (based on the interpolation of
  times associated with the [run](/models/runs) model). The units are seconds.
* `band` (integer): The SDSS filter. See [bands](/bands.html) for definitions.
* `out_of_bounds` (bool): Is the star _actually_ out of the bounds of the
  run despite the estimated cut based on `ramin`, `ramax`, `decmin` and
  `decmax`.
* `flux` (real): The measured counts of the source.
* `ferr` (real): The uncertainty in `flux`.
* `sky` (real): The measured background sky level.
* `skerr` (real): The uncertainty in `sky`.
* `dx` (real): The offset of the center of the star along the "x" coordinate
  measured in pixels.
* `dxerr` (real): The uncertainty in `dx`.
* `dy` (real): The offset of the center of the star along the "y" coordinate
  measured in pixels.
* `dyerr` (real): The uncertainty in `dy`.
